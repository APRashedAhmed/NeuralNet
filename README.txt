This neural net repository contains all the components necessary to
run the net and the data used.

The actual neural net script is in the NN.py file and also contains
the class that trains the NN.
    NNTraining.py used to contain the training class but that was
    just added into NN.py.
    
DataFormatting.py is a Pandas script meant to be used for pre-
processing of the data to maximize the NN solution convergence.

Main contains the code that will initializes the NN and the data that
will be used by it.
